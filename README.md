# Expo CLI Development Server Crash

This repository demonstrates an issue where the Expo CLI development server intermittently crashes without providing any clear error messages. The application itself builds successfully, but the development server becomes unresponsive, requiring a manual restart.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the development server.  The server may crash without warning after some time.

## Potential Causes

The exact cause of this issue is difficult to pinpoint without more information.  It could be related to:

* Memory leaks in the Expo CLI or the application.
* Resource exhaustion on the development machine.
* Conflicts with other software or processes running on the machine.
* Bugs in Expo CLI itself.

## Workarounds (Potential Solutions)

1. **Restart the server:** The most immediate fix is restarting the development server (`expo start`).
2. **Increase memory:** Allocate more RAM to the machine if available.
3. **Close unnecessary apps:**  Close any unnecessary applications that might be consuming resources.
4. **Check Expo CLI version:** Make sure you are using the latest version of Expo CLI. Run `expo upgrade` to update.
5. **Check for bugs:** Look for reported bugs on the Expo community forum or GitHub issue tracker. Some people have reported similar issue with certain libraries which may point to a conflict on the developers machine.

This issue requires further investigation to identify and resolve the underlying problem permanently.
