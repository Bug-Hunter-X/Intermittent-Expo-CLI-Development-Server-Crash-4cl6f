While a definitive solution cannot be given without further investigation into the specific circumstances causing the crash (it may be related to a specific library, memory issues or something else), here are some steps to try to mitigate the problem:

1. **Restart the development server:**  As mentioned in the Readme, this is a temporary fix. 
2. **Monitor resource usage:** Use the operating system's resource monitor to observe CPU and memory usage while the Expo server is running. This helps determine if resource exhaustion is the cause. 
3. **Simplify the app:** If possible, temporarily remove sections of your code to see if the problem persists. This can help identify whether a particular part of your application or a specific library is causing the crash.
4. **Check for updates:** Ensure your Expo CLI and any other related packages are up to date. Sometimes bugs are fixed in newer versions.
5. **Examine logs:** While the console may not show errors, it's worth checking for any warnings or unusual output from the development server that might offer clues. 
6. **Create a minimal reproducible example:**  Try to create a very small Expo app that reproduces the crash. This would make it easier to diagnose the problem and submit a bug report to the Expo team. 
7. **Consider a more stable environment:** Running the application in a virtual machine with dedicated resources can offer more control and isolation from the host system, potentially resolving the issue if it is related to resource conflicts.
